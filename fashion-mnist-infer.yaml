# Gradient Deployments: Fashion-MNIST Example
#
# This is part of our basic deployments example (https://github.com/gradient-ai/Deployments) that shows
#
# 1: Create and train a TensorFlow deep learning model using Workflows
# 2: Deploy the model using Deployments
# 3: Send inference data to the model and receive correct output
#
# This Workflow corresponds to step 3 of the above, and calls infer.py to send inference data to the model
