# Deployments

Last updated: Dec 02nd 2021

This is for blog, etc., material showing our deployments. We can rename this repo to something more specific if needed.

Initial plan is for a blog post linking to this repo that shows:

 - Create a TensorFlow model using Workflows
 - Deploy the model using Deployments
 - Send some inference data to the model

A key component of this is to show that *models created in Gradient can be deployed in Gradient*. This better tests our system and shows more value than only bringing in an outside model.

Then we can show lots of other things, e.g., canary deployments.
